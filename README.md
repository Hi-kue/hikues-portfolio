## About The Project

This project is a long and overdue portfolio website for myself. I have always been procrastinating when it comes to making a portfolio website due to the fact that there are already many websites that can do it better and it feels like I would be "reinventing the wheel". However I have come to realize that it is important to have a personal website that showcases my work and experience in a way that I can tweak and modify to fit the narrative I want to portray. With that being said welcome to my portfolio website! ðŸŽ‰

**NOTE**: Ignore the long text ðŸ˜….

## Installation & Usage

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps:

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Hi-kue/hikues-portfolio.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Run the development server
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

**NOTE**: If there are any issues, usually I use NPM but you can also use Yarn if you prefer. Just replace `npm` with `yarn` in the commands above, however if you use anything else you would need to change the commands accordingly.
